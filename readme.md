# NYJC Singapore Young Physicist Tournament 2021

## Introduction

This repository hosts the algorithms developed for Singapore Young Physicist Tournament (SYPT) 2021 by me. My team investigated problems Bead Dynamics, Wilberforce Pendulum and Dynamic Hydrophobicity. Numerical simulations are produced for the first two problems and the script for Dynamic Hydrophobicity is only used for visualising data collected. 

## Algorithms

For the mechanics problems, the scripts include solution of the equations of motion by either numerical methods (Bead Dynamics) or analytical solution (Wilberforce Pendulum). Energy profile of the system is analysed to compute the effect of friction. Visualisation and animation using Matplotlib is added whenever possible to provide a better understanding of the system.
